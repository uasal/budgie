# Reports Information

## General
If `run_report.py` is executed from command line or the `test.sh` is used, reports will be output to this directory location (unless changed) with the margin information.

## Future Implementation
- Report templates are desired to be implemented which will change how reports are generated for the tool.
- Reports directory will be removed -> output to an orphan branch with CI like other repositories in UASAL. 
- Add graphic(s) of budgets with graphviz (or another similar tool) for a tree-like diagram.
